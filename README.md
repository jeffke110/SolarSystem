🌌 C++ OpenGL Solar System
![Solar System Simulation](SolarSystemCapture.PNG) <br>
This project is a Solar System simulation built using C++ and OpenGL in Visual Studio 2022. 
This project is part of my journey learning OpenGL. It's a way to apply and demonstrate what I've learned so far, and I'm excited to keep building and expanding as I continue exploring graphics programming.

🚀 Features

🌍 Realistic planetary orbits with rotation and revolution

🛠️ Camera controls for free movement and zooming

🌠 Textured planets using OpenGL shaders

🛠️ Modular code for easy expansion

🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries:

GLFW – Window and input handling

GLAD – OpenGL function loader

GLM – Math library for 3D transformations

IMGUI - Graphical user interface library fo

2. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/jeffke110/SolarSystem.git
cd SolarSystem

3. Set Up Visual Studio 2022

Open SolarSystem.sln in Visual Studio.

Configure the include directories for GLFW, GLAD, and GLM.

Set x64 Debug/Release as the target build configuration.

4. Build and Run

Press Ctrl + Shift + B to build the project.

Press F5 to run the simulation.
